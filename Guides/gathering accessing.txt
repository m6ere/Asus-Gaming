Accessing the Gathering Areas
<b>Accessing the Gathering Areas</b>
To be able to gather recources, you first need to learn to gather them. The trainers that train you the 6 different kinds of gathering are located in 3 areas. These 3 areas are.
<u>Lacheish Plains</u>, <u>Poitain</u> and <u>Purple Lotus Swamp</u>.

These 3 areas are located outside Tortage, so you have to finish Tortage before you are able to train the gathering skills. I believe that the training is only available when you are <u>level 20 or higher</u>.


I’ll give a short walkthrough how to get from each Hub to the nearest Gathering area. Depending on the race you choose, you will start at a different Hub when you finish Tortage. The walkthrough includes some coordinates, you can find these coordinates when you open your map (located near the minimap or press M). The coordinates show below the map, the coordinates shown are the coordinates of the location of your mouse pointer on the map.
